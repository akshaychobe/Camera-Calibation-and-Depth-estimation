# Camera-Calibation-and-Depth-estimation
This repository contains the implementation of a camera calibration and depth estimation algorithm using OpenCV. The algorithm uses a checkerboard pattern to estimate the intrinsic camera matrix and distortion coefficients, and then uses the geometry of similar triangles to estimate the depth of objects in the scene.
